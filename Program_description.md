## What the program does

## Input
The user inputs an .obj file containing a three-dimensional manifold represented as a simplicial complex.
## Grids
### Creating dual grids
We create a grid aligned to the x,y,z axes by taking the bounding box of the imported .obj and subdividing it according to the selected grid density. The grid can afterwards be moved around and adjusted manually by the user using the Grid Controls context. We refer to the created grid as the Vineyards Grid and its dual grid as the Medial Axis Grid. The grid we visualize in the display window is the Vineyards Grid.
